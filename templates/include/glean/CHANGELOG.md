# Version 1

- `device_manufacturer` and `device_model` are now optional. See [Bug 1625207](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1625207).

- `extras` on an experiment may now be `null`.  See [Bug 1012940](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1612940)
   
- Added `locale` to `client_info` section. See [Bug 1601489](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1601489).

- `ping_type` in the the `ping_info` section is now optional. See [Bug 1609149](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1609149).

- An optional `reason` field has been added to `ping_info`. See [1609218](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1609218)

- Glean ping_type is kebab-case instead of snake_case.

- Label names can now be arbitrary strings, not just dotted snake_case.

- The experiment name length and experiment branch name length have been increased to 100 to match the schemas used on the experiments server.  See https://github.com/mozilla-services/remote-settings-permissions/blob/master/kinto.prod.yaml#L603-L733

- Reverted `timing_distribution` changes

- Added a memory_distribution metric type.

- Added a `quantity` metric type.

- Added a custom_distribution metric type.

- `timing_distribution` now has a fixed functional binning, so many of the
  parameters are no longer necessary (`range`, `bucket_count`, `overflow`,
  `underflow`, `histogram_type`).

- The length of labels was changed from 30 to 61 characters. This is to
  accomodate the full `category.name` identifier of a metric used for error
  reporting (which uses labeled counters).  See [1556684](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1556684).

- Make `client_id` optional.

- Make `client_info` required.

- Explicit types added for all objects and strings.

- `UUID` was removed from the `metadata` section of the parquet schema.

- The field `clientId` was changed to `client_id` to consistently use snake case
  everywhere and to match what the glean library produces.

- `first_run_date` is added as a required property to `ping_info`.

- Loosened the regular expression for labels to include `.` characters
  (required for error reporting).

- The `ping_info` section no longer allows extra properties.

- Changed datetime values from a (value, time_unit) pair to simply the raw
  value.  (Backward-incompatible change).

- Changed the event schema to drop `object`, `value` and renaming
  `method` to `name`.

- Added support for labeled metrics.

- Added support for the sending the set of active experiments in the ping_info
  section.

- Added `sum` to histogram and `timing_distribution` as optional parameter.
